* `[faccwrap~]` Float accumulator and wrapper - adds incoming float to current value for each sample
* `[qacc~]` Quaternion accumulator (quaternion multiplication and normalization of current state with incoming quaternion for each sample)
* `[qvrot~]` Quaternion-based vector rotation (expects 3-channel input for vector on left inlet and quaternion on right - outputs rotated vector)
